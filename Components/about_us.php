Our mission is to spread our passion for chess to as many kids as possible. We plan to run as many affordable, quality, chess camps for kids all the way from unrated(new to chess) to 1600 in the future as possible. We also will strive to improve where we can each and every time.  We try to strike a balance between having fun and quality instruction in our camps. All of our teachers are at least USCF experts and have had previous teaching experience. </p></center>
